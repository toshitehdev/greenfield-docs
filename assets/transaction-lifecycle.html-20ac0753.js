Stateless checks include making sure addresses are not empty, enforcing non-negative numbers, and other logic specified in the definitions.</p><p><strong><em>Stateful</em></strong> checks validate transactions and messages based on a committed state. Examples include checking that the relevant values exist and can be transacted with, the address has sufficient funds, and the sender is authorized or has the correct ownership to transact. At any given moment, full-nodes typically have multiple versions of the application&#39;s internal state for different purposes. For example, nodes will execute state changes while in the process of verifying transactions, but still need a copy of the last committed state in order to answer queries - they should not respond using state with uncommitted changes.</p><p>In order to verify a <code>Tx</code>, full-nodes call <code>CheckTx</code>, which includes both <em>stateless</em> and <em>stateful</em> checks. Further validation happens later in the <a href="#delivertx"><code>DeliverTx</code></a> stage. <code>CheckTx</code> goes through several steps, beginning with decoding <code>Tx</code>.</p><h3 id="decoding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#decoding" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Decoding</h3><p>When <code>Tx</code> is received by the application from the underlying consensus engine (e.g. Tendermint), it is still in its encoded <code>[]byte</code> form and needs to be unmarshaled in order to be processed. Then, the <code>runTx</code> function is called to run in <code>runTxModeCheck</code> mode, meaning the function will run all checks but exit before executing messages and writing state changes.</p><h3 id="validatebasic" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#validatebasic" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ValidateBasic</h3><p>Messages <code>sdk.Msg</code> are extracted from transactions (<code>Tx</code>). The <code>ValidateBasic</code> method of the <code>sdk.Msg</code> interface implemented by the module developer is run for each transaction. To discard obviously invalid messages, the <code>BaseApp</code> type calls the <code>ValidateBasic</code> method very early in the processing of the message in the <code>CheckTx</code> and <code>DeliverTx</code> transactions. <code>ValidateBasic</code> can include only <strong>stateless</strong> checks (the checks that do not require access to the state).</p><h3 id="antehandler" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#antehandler" aria-hidden="true">#</a> AnteHandler</h3><p>After the ValidateBasic checks, the <code>AnteHandler</code>s are run. Technically, they are optional, but in practice, they are very often present to perform signature verification, gas calculation, fee deduction and other core operations related to blockchain transactions.</p><p>A copy of the cached context is provided to the <code>AnteHandler</code>, which performs limited checks specified for the transaction type. Using a copy allows the <code>AnteHandler</code> to do stateful checks for <code>Tx</code> without modifying the last committed state, and revert to the original if the execution fails.</p><h3 id="gas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gas" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Gas</h3><p>The <code>Context</code>, which keeps a <code>GasMeter</code> that will track how much gas has been used during the execution of <code>Tx</code>, is initialized.

If <code>GasConsumed</code>, the amount of gas consumed so during execution, ever exceeds <code>GasWanted</code>, the execution will stop and the changes made to the cached copy of the state won&#39;t be committed. Otherwise, <code>CheckTx</code> sets <code>GasUsed</code> equal to <code>GasConsumed</code> and returns it in the result. After calculating the gas and fee values, validator-nodes check that the user-specified <code>gas-prices</code> is greater than their locally defined <code>min-gas-prices</code>.</p><h3 id="discard-or-addition-to-mempool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#discard-or-addition-to-mempool" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Discard or Addition to Mempool</h3><p>If at any point during <code>CheckTx</code> the <code>Tx</code> fails, it is discarded and the transaction lifecycle ends there. Otherwise, if it passes <code>CheckTx</code> successfully, the default protocol is to relay it to peer nodes and add it to the Mempool so that the <code>Tx</code> becomes a candidate to be included in the next block.</p><p>The <strong>mempool</strong> serves the purpose of keeping track of transactions seen by all full-nodes. Full-nodes keep a <strong>mempool cache</strong> of the last <code>mempool.cache_size</code> transactions they have seen, as a first line of defense to prevent replay attacks. Ideally, <code>mempool.cache_size</code> is large enough to encompass all the transactions in the full mempool. If the mempool cache is too small to keep track of all the transactions, <code>CheckTx</code> is responsible for identifying and rejecting replayed transactions.</p><p>Currently existing preventative measures include fees and a <code>sequence</code> (nonce) counter to distinguish replayed transactions from identical but valid ones. If an attacker tries to spam nodes with many copies of a <code>Tx</code>, full-nodes keeping a mempool cache will reject identical copies instead of running <code>CheckTx</code> on all of them. Even if the copies have incremented <code>sequence</code> numbers, attackers are disincentivized by the need to pay fees.</p><p>Validator nodes keep a mempool to prevent replay attacks, just as full-nodes do, but also use it as a pool of unconfirmed transactions in preparation of block inclusion. Note that even if a <code>Tx</code> passes all checks at this stage, it is still possible to be found invalid later on, because <code>CheckTx</code> does not fully validate the transaction (i.e. it does not actually execute the messages).</p><h2 id="inclusion-in-a-block" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#inclusion-in-a-block" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Inclusion in a Block</h2>',20),O=t("strong",null,"rounds",-1),U=t("strong",null,"validators",-1),X=t("code",null,"nil",-1),Y={href:"https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/consensus/consensus.html#terms",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Z=i(`<p>The first step of consensus is the <strong>block proposal</strong>.

Under the hood, <code>DeliverTx</code> is almost identical to <code>CheckTx</code> but calls the <code>runTx</code> function in deliver mode instead of check mode. Instead of using their <code>checkState</code>, full-nodes use <code>deliverState</code>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Decoding:</strong> Since <code>DeliverTx</code> is an ABCI call, <code>Tx</code> is received in the encoded <code>[]byte</code> form. Nodes first unmarshal the transaction, using the <code>TxConfig</code> defined in the app, then call <code>runTx</code> in <code>runTxModeDeliver</code>, which is very similar to <code>CheckTx</code> but also executes and writes state changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Checks and AnteHandler:</strong> Full-nodes call <code>validateBasicMsgs</code> and <code>AnteHandler</code> again. This second check happens because they may not have seen the same transactions during the addition to Mempool stage and a malicious proposer may have included invalid ones. One difference here is that the <code>AnteHandler</code> will not compare <code>gas-prices</code> to the node&#39;s <code>min-gas-prices</code> since that value is local to each node - differing values across nodes would yield nondeterministic results.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>MsgServiceRouter</code>:</strong> While <code>CheckTx</code> would have exited, <code>DeliverTx</code> continues to run <code>runMsgs</code> to fully execute each <code>Msg</code> within the transaction. Since the transaction may have messages from different modules, <code>BaseApp</code> needs to know which module to find the appropriate handler. This is achieved using <code>BaseApp</code>&#39;s <code>MsgServiceRouter</code> so that it can be processed by the module&#39;s Protobuf <code>Msg</code> service.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>Msg</code> service:</strong> Protobuf <code>Msg</code> service is responsible for executing each message in the <code>Tx</code> and causes state transitions to persist in <code>deliverTxState</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>PostHandlers:</strong> <code>PostHandler</code>s run after the execution of the message. If they fail, the state change of <code>runMsgs</code>, as well of <code>PostHandlers</code> are both reverted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gas:</strong> While a <code>Tx</code> is being delivered, a <code>GasMeter</code> is used to keep track of how much gas is being used; if execution completes, <code>GasUsed</code> is set and returned to the <code>abci.ResponseDeliverTx</code>. If execution halts because <code>BlockGasMeter</code> or <code>GasMeter</code> has run out or something else goes wrong, a deferred function at the end appropriately errors or panics.</p></li></ul><p>If there are any failed state changes resulting from a <code>Tx</code> being invalid or <code>GasMeter</code> running out, the transaction processing terminates and any state changes are reverted. Invalid transactions in a block proposal cause validator nodes to reject the block and vote for a <code>nil</code> block instead.</p><h3 id="commit" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#commit" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Commit</h3><p>The final step is for nodes to commit the block and state changes. Validator nodes perform the previous step of executing state transitions in order to validate the transactions, then sign the block to confirm it. Full nodes that are not validators do not participate in consensus - i.e. they cannot vote - but listen for votes to understand whether they should commit the state changes.</p><p>When they receive enough validator votes (2/3+ <em>precommits</em> weighted by voting power), full nodes commit to a new block to be added to the blockchain and finalize the state transitions in the application layer. A new state root is generated to serve as a merkle proof for the state transitions. Applications use the <code>Commit</code> ABCI method inherited from Baseapp; it syncs all the state transitions by writing the <code>deliverState</code> into the application&#39;s internal state. As soon as the state changes are committed, <code>checkState</code> start afresh from the most recently committed state and <code>deliverState</code> resets to <code>nil</code> in order to be consistent and reflect the changes.</p><p>Note that not all blocks have the same number of transactions, and it is possible for consensus to result in a <code>nil</code> block or one with none at all. In a public blockchain network, it is also possible for validators to be <strong>byzantine</strong>, or malicious, which may prevent a <code>Tx</code> from being committed in the blockchain. Possible malicious behaviors include the proposer deciding to censor a <code>Tx</code> by excluding it from the block or a validator voting against the block.</p><p>At this point, the transaction lifecycle of a <code>Tx</code> is over: nodes have verified its validity, delivered it by executing its state changes, and committed those changes. The <code>Tx</code> itself, in <code>[]byte</code> form, is stored in a block and appended to the blockchain.</p>`,13);function $(J,K){const a=c("ExternalLinkIcon"),n=c("RouterLink");return r(),l("div",null,[u,t("p",null,[e("This document describes the lifecycle of a transaction from creation to committed state changes.
