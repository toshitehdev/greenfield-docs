These validators are elected based on the Proof-of-Stake logic.</p><p>These validators are responsible for the security of the Greenfield blockchain. They get involved in the governance and staking of the blockchain. They form a P2P network that is similar to other PoS blockchain networks.</p><p>Meanwhile, they accept and process transactions to allow users to operate their objects stored on Greenfield. They maintain the metadata of Greenfield as the blockchain state, which is the control panel for both Storage Providers (SPs) and users. These two parties use and update these states to operate the object storage.</p><h3 id="greenfield-relayers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#greenfield-relayers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Greenfield Relayers</h3><p>The Greenfield Relayer is a bidirectional relaying tool that facilitates communication between Greenfield and BSC. This standalone process can only be run by Greenfield validators. The relayer independently monitors cross-chain events occurring on BSC and Greenfield, and persists them into a database. Once a few blocks confirm the event and reach finality, the relayer will sign a message using the BLS private key to confirm the event, and broadcast the signed event (known as &quot;the vote&quot;) through the P2P network on the Greenfield network. Once enough votes from the Greenfield relayer are collected, the relayer will assemble a cross-chain package transaction and submit it to the BSC or Greenfield network.</p><h3 id="storage-providers-sps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#storage-providers-sps" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Storage Providers (SPs)</h3><p>Storage Providers (SP) are storage service infrastructures that organizations or individuals provide and the corresponding roles they play. They use Greenfield as the ledger and the single source of truth. Each SP can and will respond to users&#39; requests to write (upload) and read (download) data, and serve as the gatekeeper for user rights and authentications.</p><h3 id="greenfield-dapps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#greenfield-dapps" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Greenfield dApps</h3><p>Greenfield dApps are applications that provide functions based on Greenfield storage and its related economic traits to solve some problems of their users. When users want to create and use the data on Greenfield, they may interact with the BNB Greenfield Core Infrastructure via BNB Greenfield dApps (decentralized applications). Greenfield provides a friendly smart contract library on the cross-chain facility, which can be easily integrated into dapps.</p><h2 id="participate-in-the-ecosystem" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#participate-in-the-ecosystem" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Participate in the Ecosystem</h2>',15);function f(g,u){const t=l("RouterLink");return n(),o("div",null,[p,a("ul",null,[a("li",null,[r(t,{to:"/docs/greenfield-blockchain/cli/validator-staking.html"},{default:i(()=>[e("Become A Validator")]),_:1}),e(": validators secure the Greenfield by validating and relaying transactions, proposing, verifying and finalizing blocks.")]),a("li",null,[r(t,{to:"/docs/greenfield-blockchain/cli/storage-provider.html"},{default:i(()=>[e("Become A Storage Provider")]),_:1}),e(": SPs store the objects' real data, i.e. the payload data. and get paid by providing storage services.")])])])}const v=s(h,[["render",f],["__file","ecosystem-player.html.vue"]]);export{v as default};
