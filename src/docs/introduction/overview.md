# Overview

## What is BNB Greenfield
BNB Greenfield is an innovative blockchain and storage platform that seeks to unleash the power of decentralized
technology on data ownership and the data economy. With a focus on facilitating decentralized data management and
access, Greenfield aims to revolutionize the data economy by easing the storing and management of data and linking
data ownership with the DeFi context of Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

What sets Greenfield apart from existing centralized and decentralized storage systems are its three key components:

- It allows Ethereum-compatible addresses to create and manage both data and token assets.

- It natively links data permissions and management logic onto BSC as exchangeable assets and smart contract programs
 with all other assets.

- It provides developers with similar API primitives and performance as popular existing Web2 cloud storage.

The ultimate goal of Greenfield is to establish a test field for new data economy and dApp models, which will
undoubtedly aid in the development and evolution of the foundation for Web3.

## How BNB Greenfield Works

BNB Greenfield operates on two layers:

1. It is built on a new, storage-focused blockchain; and

2. It consists of a network of "storage providers".

The BNB Greenfield blockchain maintains the ledger for users and records the storage metadata as the common blockchain
state data. Its native token for gas and governance is BNB, which is transferred from BNB Smart Chain. Additionally,
BNB Greenfield blockchain has its own staking logic designed for governance.

Storage Providers (SP) are storage service infrastructures provided by organizations or individuals that use Greenfield
as the ledger and the single source of truth. Each SP is responsible for responding to user requests to upload and
download data, while also serving as the gatekeeper for user rights and authentications.

Together, BNB Greenfield blockchain and the SPs comprise a decentralized object storage system that serves as the core
of this new economy. Developers can construct decentralized applications (dApps) using the BNB Greenfield platform,
which can act as client tools that facilitate user interactions with Greenfield; or applications that provide significant
value to users' real lives using Greenfield as their infrastructure. These applications will use blockchain addresses
as user identifiers and connect with features and smart contracts on the Greenfield blockchain, Greenfield SPs, and BSC.

A native cross-chain bridge exists between BSC and BNB Greenfield blockchain. While it is cheaper to create and access
data on Greenfield, the relevant data operation can be transferred to BSC and integrated with DeFi smart contract
systems to generate new business models.
